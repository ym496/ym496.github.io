<h1>Night</h1>
<p>09 Sep 2023</p>

<p>Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

<p>Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>

<p>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

<p>Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieve it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>

<p>Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

<p>And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

<p>— Dylan Thomas</p>
