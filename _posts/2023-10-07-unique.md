Every human is like an element in $R^n$, uniquely specified by a tuple of n-attributes. You may come across someone, with whom, some of your attributes might overlap, but never all of them.

And each attribute itself, is an associative array containing multiple variables like your competence level relative to the maximum attainable for that attribute, a distinct characteristic specific to that attribute, etc.

Maybe, the goal is figure out what that unique tuple of n-attributes is, and then max out each one of them?

Note that not always one can quantitatively describe competence level of an attribute, but the [qualitative model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence) always works eh.
